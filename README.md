Use our free Cloud Pricing API by registering for an API key:

infracost register
The key is saved in ~/.config/infracost/credentials.yml. If you prefer, you can run your own Cloud Pricing API.

Run infracost using our example Terraform project to see how it works.

git clone https://github.com/infracost/example-terraform.git
cd example-terraform

# You can play with `aws/main.tf` and `aws/infracost-usage.yml`, and re-run infracost to compare costs
infracost --terraform-dir aws --usage-file aws/infracost-usage.yml
Please watch/star this repo as we add new cloud resources every week or so.

Basic usage
There are 4 usage methods for Infracost depending on your use-case. The following is the default method. Point to the Terraform directory using --terraform-dir and pass any required Terraform flags using --terraform-plan-flags. Internally Infracost runs Terraform init, plan and show; init requires cloud credentials to be set, e.g. via the usual AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID environment variables. This method works with remote state too.

infracost --terraform-dir /path/to/code --terraform-plan-flags "-var-file=myvars.tfvars"
Read the getting started docs for details, including notes for Terragrunt and Terraform Cloud users.

As mentioned in the FAQ, you can run Infracost in your Terraform directories without worrying about security or privacy issues as no cloud credentials, secrets, tags or Terraform resource identifiers are sent to the open-source Cloud Pricing API. Infracost does not make any changes to your Terraform state or cloud resources.
